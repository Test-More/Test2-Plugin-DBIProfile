NAME

    Test2::Plugin::DBIProfile - Plugin to enable and display DBI profiling.

DESCRIPTION

    This will enable DBI::Profile globally so that DBI profiling data is
    collected. Once testing is complete an event will be produced which
    contains and displays the profiling data.

    Normal output looks like this:

        # DBI::Profile: 0.000824s (24 calls) xxx.t @ 2019-08-16 14:24:01

    If you use Test2::Harness aka App::Yath detailed profiling data is
    available in the event log.

SYNOPSIS

        use Test2::Plugin::DBIProfile;

    This is also useful at the command line for 1-time use:

        $ perl -MTest2::Plugin::DBIProfile path/to/test.t

    You can also specify a 'path' for DBI::Profile:

        use Test2::Plugin::DBIProfile "!MethodClass";

    See "ENABLING A PROFILE" in DBI::Profile for path options.

    The default is to use whatever is already in $ENV{DBI_PROFILE} if it is
    set, and to fallback to "!MethodClass" otherwise.
